# Feature-Voting technique for Fault model parameter computations
this is shared within the work progress in my phd studies at the Technion

## information about code:
the code is devided into several sub-folders to maintain some order within the code :
1. entire code runs from the FeatueVoting_5dim_MultiEpoch_git.m file
2. output folders are created from the code itself, folder-dependencies are loaded from the man m-file, edits might be needed for paths
3. FeatureVoting folder : code used for the feature-voting processes
4. General folder : code needed for entire feature-voting processes
5. _Data folder : contains data used by the code
6. dbHandle folder : code used to load and handle the data
7. GeneralMath folder : code for numerous classical mathmetical computations


code was build with Matlab version 2016b, and weas tested and run with it only.
